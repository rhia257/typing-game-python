# Speed Typing Challenge

## Description
This project demonstrates a beginner-friendly Python typing game.  
It includes multiple difficulty levels, level progression, and real-time feedback.

## Python Concepts Demonstrated
- Lists to store words for each difficulty level  
- Functions to handle game logic and level progression  
- Loops to manage rounds and levels  
- Conditional statements to check correctness and timing  
- Input/output for interactive gameplay  
- Random selection of words  

## Dataset
- Each dataset is a collection of words categorized by difficulty:  
  - easy_words: Short, simple words  
  - medium_words: Medium-length words  
  - hard_words: Long or complex words  
- Game progression depends on typing these words correctly within time limits  

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open `main.py` (or run the Jupyter Notebook)  
3. Run the word bank cell first to define the word lists  
4. Run the game functions cell to define the game logic  
5. Run the main loop cell to start the game  
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose difficulty and type the words  

## Notes
- Each difficulty level contains 20 words for beginner-friendly gameplay  
- The game can be customized by adding words, changing time limits, or adjusting level progression
